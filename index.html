                        Sleep Tracker provides a log of sleep entries entered by the user to calculate the total time in bed. <br> <br>
                        The user has the ability to edit  or delete the sleep entries. <br>  <br>We use a simple emoji rating system to 
                        calculate the mood of the user after each night, <br> <br> how the user felt during the day and how tired they were
                        before they went to bed. <br> <br> Sleep Tracker uses these ratings to determine the best sleep schedule for the user.
